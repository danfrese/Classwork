1a.	The for loop starts with "i = from + 1" because the purpose of the loop is to compare the current entry
	in the list to the element one index higher every iteration. This allwos the loop to compare entries to 
	determine the lowest element value in this iteration.
	
1b.	LinearSearcher must compare the parameter against all array elements because the program must sequentially
	look at each element in a sorted list to find the correct match. Since 9 doesn't exist in the array, all 
	elements will be compared against.
	
1c.	BinarySearcher will compare 4 elements.
