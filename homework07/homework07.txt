1a. A DNS domain name is useful for resolving names to IP addresses and in reverse. To get an IP address based 
	on the domain name, the host will consult it's internal directory first to see if it's cached a local record 
	of what IP address this DNS entry is associated to. If one isn't found, it consults its DNS server, 
	which is often the router it's connected to, otherwise a predefined DNS provider. The result returns an IP 
	address for the host to connect to.

1b.	The TCP protocol is a way for computers to communicate via streams of data. In the case of HTTP, if a computer 
	is requesting access to a HTTP resource, the browser will open a TCP stream through which the server can 
	"serve" the resource to the client's browser.
	
1c. A URLConnection object is simply an object that's been assigned to a HTTP web address. It allows the object 
	to open TCP streams of data to GET and POST information from the HTTP form but assumes a small set of predefined 
	protocols. A Socket object behaves similar to a URLConnection in that it can use the same set of predefined 
	protocols but it allows for much more flexibility and ease of use when designing a customized protocol.
