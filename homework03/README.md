#Homework 3: Classes & Methods Design

**This assignment, like the other assignments, is to be completed and submitted individually.**

In preparation for the Final Project, prepare a design for a Java program that would solve a significant business problem.
 
Select a problem such as an inventory management system, accounts receivable system, or online marketing management system. To limit the problem to a reasonable scope, assume the system will be used in a small business environment (less than 50 employees). I have provided simple business case examples but you are welcome to use a real-world business case as a basis for your evaluation.
 
Research and evaluate the essential requirements and usage of such a system, and create a design for a Java program that would solve the problem. A four to five page design document is expected.

Your solution **must include all five of these sections** (please clearly identify the sections in your document):

1. **Problem Description**: Describe the salient features and main components of the business problem. Document the sources you used to obtain the problem examples or business case information.

2. **Interpretation**: Does the business problem make sense? Did you notice any unspoken requirements that should be addressed by a solution? If you have experience relating to the business problem, can you identify anything that should be resolved differently than stated in the business case?

3. **Classes**: Detail the specific classes that would be required for the problem solution. Use the concepts from Chapter 8’s first two sections to determine what classes are best suited to the problem – as noted in Chapter 8, classes typically are related to specific “nouns” in the problem description. For example, our inventory programs used in homeworks have a Product class, which is an obvious noun relating to an inventory.

4. **Class Methods**: For each of the classes from section (2), describe in detail (but do not implement) the methods that would be required in each class. Explain the purpose and the action for each method. Remember that methods are typically “verbs” or “actions” related to the problem and its solution. For example, our Product class contains the methods “sell”, “purchase”, and “getPrice”.

5. **Summary**: Explain why your classes and methods completely solve the business problem outlined in step 1, and discuss whether your assumptions and alternatives are suitable, appropriate and completely solve the problem.

Your assignment will be graded using the College of Business’s Critical Thinking Rubric involving these four aspects:

**Problem Identification**: Correctness of description of problem & completeness of context surrounding the problem
**Information Collection and Interpretation**: Completeness of relevant information & credibility of information
**Solution Development**: Information is correctly interpreted & analyzed, assumptions are stated, and alternative solutions are discussed
**Recommendation**: The recommendation, justification, and limitations are clearly discussed and summarized.
 
Please submit your assignment to BlackBoard by attaching the text document (Word format, please) to your homework submission.
